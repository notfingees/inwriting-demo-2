Non-fungible means unique, and so NFTs are unique tokens that cannot be replaced with one another. Conversely, a fungible (non-unique) token is something like a nickel, as it can be replaced or traded for another nickel with no loss in value. NFTs have historically been used as certificates to prove ownership of a digital asset, such as a piece of art or music, but at In Writing you can do more than prove you own a text. By writing your text as an NFT, you genuinely own the text and you’re free to trade and sell it.",'A crypto wallet is essentially a digital wallet.
